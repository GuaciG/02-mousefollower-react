# 02-mousefollower-react - Follower Mouse Effect

In this exercise, a button is shown. Clicking on it, the mouse will move followed by a circle. You can deactivate it clicking again on the button. 
Then, the circle will return to its original position.

The purpose of the exercise was the use of React Hooks: useState and useEffect.

This project is one of the many projects carried out through the React course by Miguel Ángel Durán (midudev).
